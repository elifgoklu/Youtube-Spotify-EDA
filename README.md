# YouTube & Spotify Data Analysis Project

## Project Overview

This project focuses on the exploration of a dataset containing statistical information about popular songs by renowned artists across YouTube and Spotify platforms. The dataset includes metrics such as views, listens, likes, and other attributes like danceability and energy level for each song.

The analysis was conducted using Python libraries and aims to uncover patterns and insights into the music consumption habits on both platforms.

## Steps Involved:

1. **Loading the Necessary Libraries & Importing the Data**  
   Initiated by downloading required Python libraries and importing the dataset for analysis.

2. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Inspected the size of the dataset and column information.
   - Checked and corrected data types to ensure accuracy.
   - Removed unnecessary columns, such as unnamed columns, and handled missing (null) values by calculating their percentages and removing irrelevant data points.
   - Filtered the data to focus on essential features and checked for duplicate records.

3. **Data Transformation**
   - Calculated song durations in minutes for better understanding and visualization.
   - Adjusted integer values for more accurate data representation.
   - Parsed and separated numeric data for deeper analysis.

4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Created percentage distribution graphs for album types.
   - Analyzed view distributions based on danceability and energy levels across different album types.
   - Generated lists for the top 10 most viewed, liked, commented, and listened-to songs.
   - Also, identified the top artists based on various metrics such as views and listens.

5. **Visualization and Insights**  
   Visualizations included:
   - View and listen distribution of songs under 10 minutes by album type.
   - Analysis of like-to-view ratios for popular songs.
   - Top songs and artists based on views, likes, and comments.

## Conclusion

Through this analysis, I was able to uncover trends in how listeners engage with music on YouTube and Spotify. These insights can be useful for artists, producers, and marketers to better understand audience preferences and tailor their strategies.
